            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>ALbertus</hi> having of late buried the Soul of his Life <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øimena,</hi> his mo≈øt indulgent Queen, fell into extream Melancholy, which as it is commonly the Parent of all Di≈øea≈øes, ≈øo it brought him into a mo≈øt tedious and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhing Sickne≈øs, which cau≈øed him to make Moan both Day and Night; witne≈øs the bitter Groans, and pa≈ø≈øionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions for the lo≈øs of his departed Con≈øort: at la≈øt, being importuned by ≈øeveral of his Nobles, and hourly intreated by his three Sons, <hi>Philonzo, Cruentius</hi> and <hi>Innocentine,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented to ≈øend for the chiefe≈øt Doctros in tho≈øe Parts, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult about the State and Welfare of his Body; which Doctors being arrived, were pre≈øently conducted to the King's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at who≈øe ≈øight the King broke out into the≈øe ≈øad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye are come to look upon a delining King; ye may endeavour to u≈øe your Skills, but I am confident your Labour will be lost. Alas, my Di≈øea≈øe is too inward to be found out; and if ye Cure me, it must be more by Miracle than Skill: If ye can Cure an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt broken Heart, or repair my half-decayed Lungs, or re≈øtore my near-wa≈øted Breath, then draw near: But, alas, my</hi> Ly≈øime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na‚Äî And there his Sighs denying him liberty of Speech, he made Signs to be no more troubled, and turning from the Company, and almo≈øt from his own Sen≈øes, he groaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf into a deep Melancholy.</p>
               <p>The Doctors as yet being not thoroughly acquainted with his Di≈øea≈øe, verily ≈øuppo≈øed him departing but it proved otherwi≈øe; for his Sons, and the re≈øt of the Nobility inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:34307:3"/>the Doctors of his Grief, de≈øired them to u≈øe their be≈øt Endenvours for his Recovery; which accordingly they did, but finding little hopes of Life, in re≈øpect that the Di≈øtemper of his Mind bad ≈øo much impaired the Temper of his body, they only pre≈øcribed him Cordials, which indeed ≈øomething revived and exhilerated his Spirits, but could not give the lea≈øt hopes of Life, in re≈øpect that Nature was much extenuated and weakened by his extraordinary Melancholy.</p>
               <p>The King, whether le≈øs in≈øen≈øible of his Di≈øea≈øe, or ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more enlivened by the Pre≈øcriptions of the Doctors, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires two of the able≈øt of them to be brought unto him, of whem he demanded their free and ab≈øolute Opinions; The Doctors after a ≈øhort Pau≈øe, who having more re≈øpect to Con≈øcience than Gain, told him that they might prolong, but not Cure; and being about to proceed into further Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, there ≈øuddenly came in ≈øome of the Nobility, and whi≈øpered with one of the Doctors, which the King percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, demanded the Cau≈øe; to which the Nobility replyed, That there were newly arrived ≈øeveral Magicians, who hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Maje≈øty's Di≈øtemper, came out of affectionate Duty to imploy their Skill for his Recovery; the King hearing this, di≈ømi≈øt the Doctors, and admitted the Magicians, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred, and after the Performance of their ≈øeveral Duties, applyed them≈øelves in this manner:</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Magicians being gone, the King ≈øends for his three Sons, and acquaints them with what the Magicians had told him, proffering to divide his E≈øtate between them, if they could recover the <hi>Eagle</hi> from the Queen of <hi>Ivyland,</hi> wi≈øhing them to take what Trea≈øure they would for their Occa≈øions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Magicians being departed, the King immediately gave Command that his three Sons ≈øhould come unto him; they as diligent to obey, as he was willing to command, forthwith pre≈øented them≈øelves before him. The King after ≈øome Di≈øcour≈øe, told them now his Days were near fini≈øhed, and Nature began ≈øo much to decline in him, that he was pa≈øt the Skill of Doctors; therefore let me advi≈øe you, as a dying Father, that as ye were born Brothers in Nature, ≈øo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Affection. <hi>Sir,</hi> replyed the Elde≈øt, <hi>if it plea≈øe the Gods to di≈øpo≈øe of you to Death, we must labour for that Portion of Content which may be proportionable to our Sorrows; for the Decrees of Fate are not to be re≈øi≈øted; and one Rea≈øon tells us, that what we cannot remedy, we must patiently endure: But for my part (and I dare ≈øay as much for my Brothers) I would willingly hazard my Life for the Prolongation of yours. Sir, I hope that you will plea≈øe to apprehend that the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions which are like to fall to us after your Death, do not any way incite us either to hope, or wi≈øh for it.</hi> With that, the two other Brothers not able to contain any longer; de≈øired their Father to imploy them in any thing whereby they might expre≈øs their Obedience to him. To which the King (joyful to ≈øee their pa≈ø≈øionate Obedience) replyed, That there was but one way to ≈øave his Life, which was to do according to the Directions of the Magicians, who informed him, that if he could by any means recover the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb facs="tcp:34307:4"/>Eagle</hi> from the Queen of <hi>Ivyland,</hi> that then he ≈øhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtored to his former Health; But, ≈øays he, I find it a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible, therefore I ≈øhall not trouble my≈øelf with the Thoughts of obtaining it, for the Queen is of that Power and Strength, that if I ≈øhould pre≈øwade any to attempt it, I ≈øhould be guilty of their Deaths, and ≈øo depart this World with a burthen'd Con≈øcience; But, my Sons, I am very well content to leave tho≈øe Slaveries which are Attendants to a Crown; I can only pray for you, and that's my uttermo≈øt.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, ra≈øh Beginnings have mo≈øt commonly fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øions: For my part, as yet I never weighed the Bu≈øine≈øs, nor the Danger, but altogether depended upon your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as an Oracle, not dreaming but you had known the Difficulty of the Bu≈øine≈øs: But ≈øtay now, I better con≈øider the Matter, methinks it ≈øhould not be ≈øo difficult, for ≈øure we three can conquer one <hi>Eagle;</hi> for, Brother, you ≈øhall catch her, and I will warrant you my Brother and I will hold her; but where ≈øhall we find her?

               <p>As I am younge≈øt in Years, ≈øo I am la≈øt in Speech, and I could wi≈øh I might be the lea≈øt; but in re≈øpect I am to make an≈øwer to both your Demands, I mu≈øt a little exerci≈øe your Patience: 'Tis true, the Danger is great, therefore the more noble; but had you, my Brethren, according to my Father's Advice, importuned the Gods before you had undertaken this great De≈øign, que≈øtionle≈øs the one had not been filled with Doubts, nor the other with Fears, nor I with Shame for you both; you ≈øeem to be as much di≈øplea≈øed at my Words, as I am at your Actions; ≈øhall we begin to tire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we begin to do?

<pb facs="tcp:34307:10"/>leaping upon him, was on a ≈øudden carried to <hi>Green Iveyland,</hi> and in his Journey overthrew many Knights which waited there to encounter any that ≈øhould approach: But he with his good Sword and Steed made ≈ølight of 'em; then he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Brazen Walls, where he was welcomed with the Roaring of Lions and Dragons, but as he brandi≈øhed his Sword they fell into a dead Sleep, then <hi>Innocentine</hi> pa≈ø≈øed freely: not long after he came to a Fort which was guarded by Giants, who when they perceived his Approach, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently came running at him with great Violence, but he no ≈øooner brandi≈øh'd his ≈øword but they fell all a≈øleep.

Having done the≈øe things, he writes the≈øe Lines, and pins them upon the Sleeve of her Garment:

               <p>
                  <hi>PHilonzo</hi> and <hi>Cruentius</hi> having ≈øpent mo≈øt of their Money, at la≈øt agreed with ≈øome in the City to get them an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; which they pretended they could do, which was not long effecting, for they got a very great Fowl, the neare≈øt they could like an Eagle, and guilded his Feathers, and brought it to them, which they with much Joy accepted, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a large Sum for it, and forthwith departed the City; but as they travelled, it was their Fortune to meet their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Innocentine</hi> carrying an Eagle in a ≈øilver Cage, at the ≈øight whereof their Eagle trembled and dyed; but without the lea≈øt Salute to their Brother, they run upon him, and would have killed him; but he, according to his Advice had hid the Ring and Picture in a private place about him, which they di≈øcover'd not, but took away Cage and Eagle, with full intent to kill him; but he with many pa≈ø≈øionate Expre≈ø≈øions diverted their Intentions, promi≈øing them to become their Servant, and never betray them to his Father: they hearing the≈øe Promi≈øes, ≈øaved his Life, and ≈øo he became their Servant, and they journeyed together; at la≈øt coming home, and carrying their Eagle in Triumph, they were ioyfully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; the King embracing the two Elde≈øt, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Younge≈øt to be immediately put to Death for tho≈øe Lyes which his Brothers had related of him; but <hi>Innocentine</hi> heartily begg'd of his Father that he might not be put to Death, and ≈øo did his Brothers ≈øeemingly, but that he might be made Inferior to the wor≈øt Servant in the Hou≈øe, to which the King, though, unwilling, agreed: Thus was poor <hi>Innocentine,</hi> that de≈øerved a ju≈øt Reward, ca≈øt out of his Father's Favour for ever. But it happened that not long after the Queen of <hi>Green Ivy-land,</hi> hearing where her Eagle
<pb facs="tcp:34307:12"/>was, came with a great Train to <hi>Arragon,</hi> and pre≈øented her≈øelf to the King, who was ab≈øolutely cured by the Vertue of the Eagle. The Queen receiving that bountiful Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment which her E≈øtate required, asked the King how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sons he had; to which the King replied, Two; ≈øhe de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ≈øhe might be allowed ≈øo great a Favour as to ≈øee them; immediately they appeared; ≈øo ≈øhe called <hi>Philonzo,</hi> and asked him if he was the Man that made ≈øo gallant an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for her Eagle; he replied, It was his poor Endeavour that obtained it. Pray, ≈øays ≈øhe, let me ≈øee ≈øome A≈ø≈øurance; did you leave me nothing, nor take nothing from me? No, replied <hi>Philonzo.</hi> Then, quoth the Queen, you are not the Man; after him was pre≈øented <hi>Cruentius,</hi> whom the Queen in like manner greeted, but he replied as <hi>Philonzo</hi> did, That he took nothing from her, nor left any thing with her. The Queen concealing her Anger, told the King that the≈øe My≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries pa≈øt her Imaginations; de≈øired the King ingeniou≈øly to tell her if he had no more Sons. Renowned Queen, I mu≈øt confe≈øs I had another Son, which now I own not; I think he may be living among≈øt the mean Servants of my Hou≈øe, but for a Son I own him not. To which the Queen replied, ≈øhe mu≈øt needs ≈øee him; Alas, replied the King, I think him not worthy of my Pre≈øence, much more of ≈øo renowned a Queen as your≈øelf: but to ≈øatisfie your Reque≈øts, he ≈øhall be called; in the mean time the King departed, whil≈øt <hi>Innocentine</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Queen's Pre≈øence, to whom the Queen di≈øcours'd as follows:</p>
               <p>Are you the younge≈øt Son of this Royal King, or no? he replied, with a blu≈øhing Countenance, No. What, are you his Servant? he replied, No. Friend, you ≈øpeak very my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterou≈øly, di≈øcover thy ≈øelf. Then know, incomparable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that my Father being incens'd again≈øt me, condemn'd me to dye; but by the Reque≈øt of my Brothers I was pre≈øerved, and became a Servant to the wor≈øt of my Father's Servants, contenting my ≈øelf with the≈øe poor Habiliments, which indeed were they as rich as could be imagined, were too mean to be
<pb facs="tcp:34307:12"/>pre≈øented before ≈øo worthy a Per≈øon, as, Madam, you are; and for my≈øelf, I could tremble into A≈øhes at the ≈øight of ≈øo excellent a Creature as your vertuous ≈øelf; but I ≈øhall remove ≈øo unworthy an Object from your Sight, and crave Licen≈øe to depart. No, replyed the Queen, you ≈øhall not; I have a few que≈øtions to ask you. My Rudene≈øs, mo≈øt unparrall'd La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ≈øhall be as obedient to reply, as your Grace ≈øhall be ready to demand, although I am unworthy to be the lea≈øt of your Creatures. The Queen hearing him expre≈øs him≈øelf with ≈øo much Humility, and Excellency of Speech, the King for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his Son was there, came ≈øuddenly into the Pre≈øence of Queen, and beholding his Out-ca≈øt, ≈øtarted back; the Queen perceiving it, de≈øir'd the King to yield her ≈øo great a Favour as to ≈øtay to hear her ask his Son two or three Que≈øtions; the King not u≈øing to deny the Reque≈øt of ≈øuch Per≈øons, ≈øate down, whil≈øt the Queen thus expre≈øt her≈øelf to <hi>Innocentine:</hi> Was it you that took my Eagle from me, pray an≈øwer me without Ceremony? To which he bowing him≈øelf, replyed, Madam, I did. And what Token left you with me, or took from me? Madam, a Lock of your Hair. Where is it? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Queen. Next my Heart, Madam, replied <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centine,</hi> and here it is. But what did you leave me? ≈øaid the Queen. A Lock of mine, replied <hi>Innocentine.</hi> Great Prince, (≈øaid the Queen to the King) and here it is; but pray let your Patience expect my farther Di≈øcour≈øe with him; Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øaid the Queen, to ba≈øhful <hi>Innocentine,</hi> do you know this Picture and this Ring? Yes, Madam, and I hope your Greatne≈øs knows the≈øe, (≈øhewing her the Picture and Ring which he had took from her.) Come, ≈øays the Queen, give me the Picture, and in≈øtead of the Shadow, take the Sub≈øtance; I am re≈øolved, renowned King, not to depart, till I have made him Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of all I have. Admire it not; for it is nothing but Truth.</p>
               <p>The King, like a Man tran≈øported, at fir≈øt thought the Queen to be po≈ø≈øe≈øt of a Frenzy, but after more ≈øerious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, found all Truth which ≈øhe had related, and pre≈øently
<pb facs="tcp:34307:13"/>≈øent for his two Sons, <hi>Philonzo</hi> and <hi>Cruentius,</hi> and commands their Heads to be ≈øtruck off; but <hi>Innocentine</hi> ≈øeconded with his incomperable Lady, per≈øwaded his Father to ≈øave their Lives, and bani≈øh them; which the King, though unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, con≈øented to, after which he imbraced his Son, and told him, in Requital of his great Abu≈øes, he would ≈øettle his Kingdom upon him. The Queen joyful to ≈øee the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Son, de≈øired the King that hereafter he would plea≈øe to own her as his obedient Daughter. So <hi>Innocentine</hi> and the Queen were ≈øhortly after married, and departed into their own Country of <hi>Ivy land.</hi>
